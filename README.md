# KitchenAid

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.1.

Kitchen Aid enables you to add new recipes but also manage and delete your existing recipes. You are also able to add their ingredients to the shopping list, which is also editable. All data is stored in a Firebase database, so initially, before you can access your recipes and shopping list, authentication is required where you have the option to sign up or log in. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
